This project displays images of money bags and moves, grows, bounces off boundaries, and reverses direction when collided with other money bags.

Extra feature: plays a sound every time money bags collide.

**Sometimes there may be too many money bags and they may get stuck when trying to bounce off multiple objects. Simply just restart the program.**
